# What the project is about

The goal of this project is to create a room manager designed to be used for a specific building. The room manager will allow users to easily schedule and manage the usage of rooms within the building.

This project is designed for individuals who need to navigate a complex building quickly and efficiently. With our room manager, users will be able to easily find and navigate to their desired room, making it a valuable tool for anyone who frequently visits or works in a large, complex building.

This project not only allows users to easily navigate the building, but also provides a convenient way for users to view and manage their room reservations. Users will have the ability to add, delete and reschedule reservations, making it a comprehensive tool for managing room usage and availability within the building.

The site will be called **RoomMate** for Resourceful, Organized, On-demand, Omniscient Meeting management and the url could look like "www.room.edu" for educational purposes.
